# Classics corpus ingestion

This app now has the first production-oriented slice for classical saju evidence:

- Vendor input: `external/saju_corpus_package/`
- Migration: `supabase/migrations/006_classics_corpus.sql`
- Evidence route: `GET /api/classics/evidence?concept=용신`
- UI surface: saju result page, below the existing classical citation summary

## Current scope

The first pass is metadata-first and offline-first. It creates tables for source, work, version, section, passage, Korean reading, Korean translation, commentary, concept tags, ingest runs, and validation runs. It also seeds source and version metadata from the provided manifest for the public-safe candidates:

- `滴天髓`
- `窮通寶鑑`
- `三命通會 (四庫全書本)`

No live scraping is part of this milestone.

## Applying the schema

Apply the Supabase migrations in order, including `006_classics_corpus.sql`.

The evidence route uses the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` path because corpus reads are served through the app API, not directly from the browser. If the schema is not applied yet, the route returns a setup-required state instead of breaking the page.

## Passage ingestion sequence

This PR adds the first ingest CLI for the three public-safe Wikisource candidates.
The default mode is a dry run, so it collects and normalizes text without writing
to Supabase:

```bash
npm run ingest:classics -- --source=wikisource --dry-run
```

To collect one work only:

```bash
npm run ingest:classics -- --source=wikisource --work=ditian-sui --dry-run
```

Supported work keys:

- `ditian-sui`
- `qiongtong-baojian`
- `sanming-tonghui-siku`

After confirming dry-run counts, apply to Supabase with the service-role key from
`.env.local`:

```bash
npm run ingest:classics -- --source=wikisource --work=all --apply
```

For an initial clean load, after confirming there are no reviewed Korean reading
or translation rows yet, replace generated sections/passages for the target work:

```bash
npm run ingest:classics -- --source=wikisource --work=all --apply --replace
```

Then validate corpus counts:

```bash
npm run validate:classics
```

To add the first unreviewed Korean UI summaries for concept-tagged passages:

```bash
npm run seed:classics-summaries
npm run seed:classics-summaries -- --apply
npm run validate:classics -- --min-ui-summaries=1
```

The CLI uses the MediaWiki Action API `action=parse` result for `wikitext`,
`sections`, and `revid`. Each passage row stores source page and revision data in
`source_line_ref`, plus a `provenance_hash`. It also attaches low-confidence
`classic_passage_concept_tags` when an exact Chinese keyword maps to an existing
concept tag, so Korean queries such as `용신` can return initial original-text
evidence before translation and commentary layers are reviewed.

`classic_passages` must carry the audit/export snapshot directly on the passage
row:

- `work_version_id`
- `section_path`
- `passage_no`
- `original_text_zh`
- `source_line_ref`
- `provenance_hash`
- `license_label`
- `verification_status`

`license_label` is copied from the effective source/version license at ingest
time. For Wikisource rows this preserves the public-domain/CC BY-SA attribution
condition alongside the original passage text instead of relying only on joined
metadata.

1. Pick one `classic_work_versions` row whose `public_release_status` is `live` and whose `verification_status` is `provisional` or `reviewed`.
2. Load source text from approved local/offline material first. For the current Wikisource collector, use dry-run before applying and preserve page revision provenance.
3. Insert `classic_sections` with stable `section_key`, `section_path`, source references, and sort order.
4. Insert `classic_passages` with `section_path`, `original_text_zh`, optional `normalized_text_zh`, `source_line_ref`, `provenance_hash`, `license_label`, and `verification_status`.
5. Add `classic_readings_ko`, `classic_translations_ko`, and `classic_commentaries` only when their generation source and review state are explicit. The first Korean UI layer uses `classic_commentaries.commentary_type = 'ui_summary'`, `generated_by = 'hybrid'`, and `review_status = 'unreviewed'`.
6. Attach `classic_passage_concept_tags` for concepts such as `용신`, `조후`, `격국`, `강약`, `합충`, `공망`, and `신살`. The first Wikisource pass uses exact Chinese keyword tagging only; review-backed tags can overwrite or extend this later.
7. Record each batch in `classic_ingest_runs`.

## Provenance checklist

Every passage should preserve:

- Source name and URL through `classic_sources` and `classic_work_versions`
- Source work reference, edition name, edition type, completeness status, and verification status
- Source line or section reference when available
- License label or source-specific license override
- Suspect flags for OCR, missing sections, unclear source, or incomplete pages

## Release gates

Only expose passages through the evidence API when:

- `public_release_status = 'live'`
- `verification_status IN ('reviewed', 'provisional')`
- The source license/terms allow the intended display
- The passage has passage-level provenance

Keep these blocked or reference-only until manually reviewed:

- General `三命通會` Wikisource page with missing 권10-권12
- `淵海子平` Wikisource page marked unfinished/source-unclear
- `子平真詮評注` when it is being treated as if it were the base text
- CText OCR/community text as a standalone public source

## Verification

After ingesting passages, verify:

- `GET /api/classics/evidence?concept=용신` returns only live/reviewed or live/provisional rows.
- The saju result page renders original text, source reference, and license label.
- `npm run typecheck` still passes.
- Any ingest script logs a `classic_ingest_runs` row with record counts and errors.
